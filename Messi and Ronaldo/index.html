        <p>This in no way is a comparision. It more made out of respect considering what they have achieved in their
            career's till now. Since their era is coming to an end and a new era is starting in world football, we will
            never know when will be able to see this kind of rivalry again. It is for sure that this rivalry will be
            remembered by all. People will remember <b>Messi</b> for his talent and skills whereas people will remember
            ronaldo as a guy whose hardwork made him achieve all of this. It is my tribute to two of the greatest
            players of all time who have graced the pitch.</p>
